## **Machine Learning Models**  

### Disease Prediction Model  
Uses Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to predict diseases based on symptoms. It:  
- Accepts symptoms as input and converts them into one-hot encoded vectors.  
- Predicts diseases using all three models and determines the final prediction via statistical mode.  
- Provides fallback mechanisms for invalid inputs or prediction conflicts.  

### Doctor-Specialization Mapping System  
- Maps diseases to specializations using a JSON-based system.  
- Retrieves doctor details for a given specialization to recommend suitable professionals.

## **APIs and Libraries**  

1. **Google OAuth 2.0 API**: For secure user authentication.  
2. **SMTP**: Sends emails for confirmations, reminders, and bed requests.  
3. **APScheduler**: Schedules tasks and reminders.  
4. **Google Geocoding API**: Converts addresses into geographical coordinates.  
5. **Geopy**: Fetches location data and calculates distances.
